## About this repository

This repository contains the experimentation done for the paper "Hardware Countersâ€™ Space Reduction for Code Region Characterization" published in Euro-Par 2019, which can be found in:

In this paper we introduce a methodology, based in PCA and correlation analysis, for reducing the number of hardware performance counters needed for characterizing an OpenMP parallel region.

** Please, reference this paper if you use these results!!


## How to execute the examples

In order to run the examples you need to install:

[`Python 3.6`](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

[`R 3.6`](https://cran.r-project.org/)

[`Jupyter`](https://jupyter.org/)


## File description

* PCA and Correlation All Hardware Counters.ipynb :
	Script in jupyter notebook which uses R to make a PCA with the information obtained with the hardware performance counters for the different patterns.
	After the PCA is executed, a correlation analysis is performed and three correlation matrices are shown using different sorting of the columns.

* PCA and Correlation Reduced List.ipynb :
	This is the final evolution of the previous jupyter notebook. In this case we have reduced the number of available events to the limit we found without losing information.
	To reproduce the middle steps, the previous script should be executed multiple times reducing the number of events until this script is obtained.
	
* Neural Network.ipynb :
	This is a jupyter notebook using Python. A simple neural network is used to verify that the resulting hardware performance counters can be used to identify the different parallel regions.
	We use a simple neural network with one hidden layer. The data used for training it consists of the results of the executions for all data sizes except for two, which are used in the predictions to test if the characterization can be performed.

Sometimes github fails opening jupyter notebooks, if this problem appears, use nbviewer: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/
